# 🐸 Leafy Code Runner 🌿  
**A Gamified Compiler Design Project**

## 🎯 What is This?

Leafy Code Runner is a visual, interactive compiler designed to make programming fun and beginner-friendly.  
Instead of boring error messages, your commands make a **frog jump, move, spin, glow, and sparkle**!

✅ Real-time code parsing  
✅ Frog animation using `Canvas API`  
✅ Fun commands like `glow();`, `float();`, `jump();`  
✅ Emoji coding support for accessibility  
✅ Designed for students, schools, and visual learners

## 🧠 Why We Built This?

Traditional compilers are intimidating.  
We asked: *What if coding was like playing in a jungle?*

So we built a frog-powered visual language that:
- Helps beginners understand compiler concepts
- Shows lexical analysis and parse trees
- Animates code as real movement
